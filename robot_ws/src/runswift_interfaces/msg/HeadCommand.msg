# Angles
float32 yaw           # LEFT-RIGHT motion. Positive is LEFT
float32 pitch         # UP-DOWN angle. Positive is DOWN
bool is_relative    # TRUE to add to current head angles (vs absolute)

# Speeds
float32 yaw_speed     # Speed of the yaw [0.0, 1.0]
float32 pitch_speed   # Speed of the pitch [0.0, 1.0]
