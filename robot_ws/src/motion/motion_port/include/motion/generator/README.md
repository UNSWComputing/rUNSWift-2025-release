adding a readme because these generators are confusing:
- ActionGenerator : Basically runs pos files
- BodyModel : Not explicitly a generator, seems to help with some modelling that some generators use. not sure why it's in this folder
- ClippedGenerator : wraps a generator and clips the joint values
- UnstiffGenerator : Unstiffs the robot. Generally unused as our pattern is often to use pos files that end in unstiffening but used in some edge cases where we want to be explicit
- DistributedGenerator : Chooses between generators based on action request
- Generator : parent class
- GetupGenerator : basically an action generator but does some choosing of which getup
- HeadGenerator : moves the head
- NullGenerator : for when no action request is sent
- RefPickupGenerator : Theoretically has timed stopping over a stand ActionGenerator. I think this means when stopped it first completes it's stand. Not sure why it wasn't just a stand generator with higher priority. uses 100 for stopping (v5 leftover should probably be 83 since pos duration is 1000 and generators run once a tick)
- Walk2014Generator : walks and kicks and probably some other stuff
- WalkEnginePreProcessor : I'm not sure
